                  The process of designing a website: email me to schedule an
                  appointment in Inland Empire. If a physical appointment is not
                  necessary, we can chat about your vision.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I will produce a written quote based on your vision and the
                  number of revisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I will produce a design concept of your website before any
                  coding is done and ensure you are happy with the design.

              <h4>Web Development</h4>
              <p>
                I have programming knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,
                Angular, React, PHP, MySQL, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
                to help your clients find you on the web.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  I will program your website using code that is clean and easy
                  to read.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I test the code in my web browser to ensure everything flows
                  and reads correctly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I design for mobile devices first, then for desktop, as most
                  transactions are mobile-driven.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I stand behind the code and product that I release to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You will receive an email containing all the coding files from
                  your website design.
